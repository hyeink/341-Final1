            <p><b>Hawaii</b> is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.</p>

          My film ideas take a critical view of social, political, cultural and environmental issues. My work mostly tends to focus on the environment. Influenced by Hayao Miyazaki, one of the greatest Japanese animation director and who created the movie Sprited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke, I always want to make a film about the human and the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          I like to set up the film ideas in the notebook. I never sleep without a notebook beside me so I can write down dreams that I had and other times I develop into more in-depth ideas and screen plays.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          At school, the classes I really paid any attention in were art and philosophy. Learning logic and philosophy from the old philosophers made me think about the relationship between the world, human and the environment. I always try to depict a positive message that the persistence of nature in recapturing what once belonged to the earth.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Some of my subject matter is about people’s daily routines especially about my story. What I’ve seen, what I’ve experienced, and what I’ve listened are influenced to my works. My life has been normal, but also has been unique itself which can be attractive in film. I like to develop my story into deeper thought what I have.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          None of this was intentional – it all developed and evolved over time. One of the reason why I love films is my parents who love films. I’ve been growing up watching films and talking about the films with my parents. So, I’ve always been thinking about being film directors since I was elementary school student.
